Opencart-Responsive-Default-Theme
=================================

We know the official Opencart Default Theme is not responsive.

That's why we name this theme as "Opencart Responsive Default Theme", which means it's based on and let the OpenCart Default Theme to be responsive.


Note: this theme is hard related with my project on-hand, unless you do the same configuration on backend, you would find it's not completely compatable with Opencart default demo data/configuration. For example, the size of Nivo Slide, and the sizes of products' photos.
