	-	*.tpl: 				remove all version logs from tpl files, for these would cause many issues, particularly for IE 9-, for IE knows comments tags: <!-- -->
	-	header.tpl: 		use downlevel-revealed conditional comments in header.tpl, so as only loading responsive.css when !IE or IE 9 +
	-	return_form.tpl:	add this module and remove $(colorbox).colorbox snippet for running js error: $(...).colorbox is not a function
